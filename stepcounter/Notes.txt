This file contains notes and assumptions that I made

AXIS CHOICE
For the step counter to work, the device must be held flat. Eg. how it would sit flat on a table.
Therefore, I used the accelerometer Z axis measurements to measure steps since Z will translate to up/down motion when the device is in this orientation.

MEDIAN FILTERING
For median filtering I use an ArrayList called recentValues to keep track of the most recent values. The number of values that I kept is defined in RECENT_VALUES_SIZE.
Each time the sensor event fires, I remove the oldest and add the newest value.
There is a variable called MEDIAN_FILTER_SIZE that specifies how many recent values to calculate the median.

DE-MEANING
I use the values stored in recentValues to calculate the mean of the recent values.
I use this mean and subtract it from the values that have a median filter applied.
This worked well in bringing values back to around 0 so I can use zero-crossing.

ZERO CROSSING
When the device is sitting on a desk the sensor still fires events and values will cross zero.
I set a threshold called ZERO_CROSS_THRESHOLD so that a value must go above that value and then below the that same (negative) value to be counted.

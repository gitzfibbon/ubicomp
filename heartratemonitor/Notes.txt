This file contains decisions and assumptions for A2.

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Place your index finger over the device's camera
2. Use a bright light source and aim it closely at the finger that is covering the camera
3. Hold your finger and the light in the position for 5+ seconds

CONFIGURATION SETTINGS

RGB CHOICE
After observing the change in R, G and B values when a finger is placed over the camera it appeared that red had the most pronounced fluctuations.
Thus, after much experimentation I chose to use only those values of the images to measure heart rate. This can be easily configured/changed in the code to use any combination of RGB.

MEDIAN FILTERING
I did median filtering and plotted it on the UI. However, it did not seem very useful given the small sample rate of 10-15 fps.
I did not use any median filtered values in my calculations for heart rate.

DE-MEANING
I used the previous 30 recorded frames for de-meaning. This results in ~2 seconds of data at 15 fps.

PEAK DETECTION
I implement simple peak detection. A peak occurs when the slope of the line changes from negative to positive (a 'valley') and the valley is under
the threshold value of -1.0
I used the unfiltered red channel mean of the frame and de-meaned it, then applied peak detection.
